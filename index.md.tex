I am a computational neuroscientist with a background in engineering and physics. My research is focused on understanding neural computation across scales: how interactions among neurons produce population-level information representations. I approach this question through data analysis and data-driven modeling.  

I am currently working as an [Alexander von Humboldt](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/humboldt-research-fellowship) postdoctoral research fellow in [Prof. Henning Sprekeler's group](https://www.sprekelerlab.org/) at the Technical University of Berlin, in collaboration with [Prof. Timothy O'Leary](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?tso24) at the University of Cambridge. In this project, we are studying the role of inhibition in representational drift.  

In June 2023, I successfully defended my PhD at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I carried out my doctoral work under the supervision of [Prof. Stefano Nichele](https://nichele.eu) at Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet). In 2022, I spent six months visiting Prof. Timothy O'Leary's group at the University of Cambridge. I earned my Master in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Porto in 2018, with thesis work conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Paulo Aguiar](https://www.i3s.up.pt/research-group.php?groupid=125) at the Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S), and my Bachelor in Applied and Engineering Physics from Cornell University in 2010.
