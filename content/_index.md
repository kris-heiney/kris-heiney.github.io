I am a PhD Fellow at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet).
I earned my Bachelor in Applied and Engineering Physics from Cornell University in 2010 and my Master in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Porto in 2018.

I study neural computation through multielectrode data analysis, and I am interested in understanding neural function at the scale of populations of neurons.
