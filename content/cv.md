## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**PhD Fellow** Oct 2018 – present  
[Living Technology Lab](http://www.nichele.eu/), Oslo Metropolitan University  
[SOCRATES](https://www.ntnu.edu/socrates): Self-Organizing Computational substRATES, funded by the Research Council of Norway  
Supervisor: Dr. Stefano Nichele  

_I am studying the electrophysiological behavior of neurons in vitro using microelectrode array data with the aim of understanding computationally beneficial features of their dynamics and organization_

**Master-level researcher** Feb 2017 – Jun 2018  
[Neuroengineering and Computational Neuroscience group](https://www.i3s.up.pt/research-group?x=125), i3S  
Supervisor: Dr. Paulo Aguiar  

_I created and published an [advanced computational tool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42148-3) based in MATLAB for the analysis of electrophysiological signals recorded from neurons cultured on microelectrode arrays interfaced with microfluidic chambers_
